# WoW Scripts
- This repo is mainly for scripts involved with WoW.
- The main goal of this is to create a fishing script that works with AHK and possibly just pixel match instead of using machine learning (opencv).

## Paste Script (Test Script for Pasting PrintScreen into Paint)

## PrintScreen Script (Test Script for PrtSc Button - PrtSc was incorrect in AHK Docs)
